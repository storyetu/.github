## 📖 The Story Behind "Storyetu"

**Storyetu** comes from the Swahili word *"Yetu"* (Ours). It is **"Our Story."**

In a digital world often filled with noise and rapid consumption, we are consciously designing a quiet corner focused on **connection**. We believe technology shouldn't just distract children; it should be a tool designed to bring parents, guardians, and children together through the ancient art of storytelling.

### 🎨 Our Four Pillars

As illustrated in our vision banner above, our code is guided by these four commitments:

| Icon | Pillar | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 🛡️ | **Radical Safety** | We treat children's privacy as sacred. No dark patterns, no data harvesting, and a secure environment ("The Shield") where parents can breathe easy. |
| ✨ | **Active Imagination** | We build tools that turn children from passive consumers into active creators. We want them drawing, writing, and speaking their own worlds into existence. |
| 🐘 | **Cultural Depth** | Like the Baobab tree and the Elephant, our stories are rooted in wisdom. We encourage content that bridges generations and cultures. |
| ❤️ | **Family Bonding** | If our software doesn't bring a parent and child closer together—whether they are on the same couch or continents apart—we haven't done our job. |
